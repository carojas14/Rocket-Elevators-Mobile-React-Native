# Rocket Elevators Mobile React Native

The mobile application has been created only for Rocket Elevators employees.

If the employee's email exists among the list the user of the App is directed to a home screen.

* Home screen, shows a list of elevators that are not in operation and allows employees to select one of them.
When selecting an elevator from the list, the user is directed to a elevator status screen.
